# YourSem

> A CRUD application which stores your every semester scores. It keeps a record of your performance. 

<img src="https://github.com/theIYD/YourSem/blob/master/assets/sample.gif">

The application is purely made to **practice** Node.js, ExpressJS &amp; MongoDB. Being practicing client-side Javascript for sometime, gave a chance to back-end.

### Features
  - Login and register functionality using **Passport.js**
  - Create semesters, add your own subjects and accordingly add the marks.
  - Hash the user password using **bcryptjs**
  - Show **success** and **error** messages using **connect-flash**
  - Render HTML using **Handlebars.js**
  - Use **mongoose** and **MongoDB** for database management

### Usage
Clone the repository, install the dependencies and start the server

$ git clone https://github.com/theIYD/YourSem
